# Polynomial Arithmetic with C++ Templates

This project implements a robust framework for polynomial arithmetic using C++ classes and templates. It defines two core components: the `Monomial` class for representing individual terms in a polynomial, and the `Polynomial` class for manipulating collections of monomials. 

# Key features include:
- **Operator Overloading**: Support for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials.
- **Polynomial Evaluation**: Evaluate polynomials for specific input values.
- **Efficient Management**: Use of STL containers (`std::list`) for efficient storage and manipulation of polynomial terms.
- **Template-based Flexibility**: The implementation is fully generic, allowing polynomials with different number types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers).

This project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented design, operator overloading, and advanced C++ features such as templates and move semantics.
